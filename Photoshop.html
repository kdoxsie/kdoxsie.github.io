        <br> I had the idea for this Photoshop project months before class started after snapping this photo of my cat, Rue. I instantly thought she looked like a giant monster cat that had just taken over the city, so I decided to make her into a supervillian -<em> Giganticat </em>- in her very own movie poster. Photoshop was a difficult application to work with as it was not very intuitive, but I'm hoping to get  better at it by taking the Photoshop course over the summer.

        <p><em>Giganticat may have destroyed the city, but will she get away with it...? </em> </p>
