        Hi! I'm Kaity. I am currently pursuing a certificate in Visual Media Design from CCSF. <br>I became interested in the field after creating the invitations, programs, and signs for my wedding using the only program I knew- Microsoft Word. I loved the process, but I knew there had to be a better way. I am excited to master the Adobe suite during this program so I can create visually appealing stationary and signage for future brides. <br>My current hobbies and interests include cooking, health, cats, yoga, and being outdoors.
        </p>
