        <em> It's the moment you've been waiting for... play the short animation above to find out how the Giganticat v. Ratman saga comes to an end! Who will prevail?! </em>

    <p> I had a "blast" creating this animation, even though it was tedious and time-consuming at times. It definitely made me appreciate all of the work that goes into creating feature-length animated films. I was unhappy with the way I had cut out my cat's image for the Photoshop project, so I redid the selection for this project so that her outline looked less harsh and more realistic.
