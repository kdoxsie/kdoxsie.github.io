    <br>For my InDesign project, I wanted to do something a little different than the rest of the class. I have been enthusiastically following a Ketogenic diet for the past couple months, so I decided to create recipe cards for some of my favorite dishes. I really enjoyed making these cards because this is something I could see myself using InDesign to create in the future. If only I had known how to use InDesign when I was creating my wedding stationary- it makes everything look so much better than using Microsoft Word!
